Assist me in crafting a JUnit test for a particular Java method using JUnit 5 and Mockito 3. I'll supply the method's source code, along with relevant method signatures, fields, dependencies, the containing Java class, expected behavior, and dependent classes in the project. Develop a test that includes essential imports, compiles error-free, and attains optimal branch and line coverage. No need for additional explanations.
