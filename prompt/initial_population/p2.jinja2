In order to achieve maximum branch and line coverage, create a JUnit test for a specific Java method using JUnit5 and Mockito3. I will provide the source code, relevant method signatures and fields, required dependencies, Java class containing the method, expected behavior, and dependent classes in the project. The test should import necessary dependencies and compile without errors. No explanations needed.
