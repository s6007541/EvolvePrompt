To achieve maximum branch and line coverage, create a test using JUnit5 and Mockito3 for a specific Java method. I will provide the source code, relevant method signatures and fields, required dependencies, Java class containing the method, expected behavior, and dependent classes in the project. The test should import necessary dependencies and compile without errors. No explanations needed.
