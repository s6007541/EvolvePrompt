Maximize branch and line coverage by devising a JUnit test for a specific Java method, harnessing the power of JUnit5 and Mockito3. The method's source code, relevant signatures, and fields, along with required dependencies, the Java class encapsulating the method, expected behavior, and interconnected project classes will be provided. Ensure the test imports necessary dependencies seamlessly and compiles error-free, without the need for additional explanations.
