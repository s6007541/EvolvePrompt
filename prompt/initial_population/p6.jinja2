I'm looking for assistance in crafting a JUnit test for a specific Java method using JUnit 5 and Mockito 3. You'll receive the method's source code, relevant method signatures, fields, required dependencies, the Java class containing the method, expected behavior, and information on dependent classes in the project. Develop a test that encompasses essential imports, compiles without errors, and achieves optimal branch and line coverage. No additional explanations required.
