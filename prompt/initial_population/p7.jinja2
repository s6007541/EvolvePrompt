Assist me in formulating a JUnit test for a precise Java method employing JUnit 5 and Mockito 3. I'll provide the method's source code, along with pertinent method signatures, fields, essential dependencies, the hosting Java class, expected behavior, and details about dependent classes in the project. Develop a test that includes vital imports, compiles seamlessly, and ensures optimal branch and line coverage. No need for further explanations.
