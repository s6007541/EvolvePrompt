Generate a JUnit test using JUnit5 and Mockito3 for a given Java method. I'll supply the method's source code, relevant signatures and fields, required dependencies, the Java class housing the method, expected behavior, and related project classes. Develop a test that imports the necessary dependencies, compiles error-free, and attains optimal branch and line coverage. Explanations are not required.
