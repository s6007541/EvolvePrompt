For a specific Java method, I need assistance in crafting a JUnit test using JUnit 5 and Mockito 3. Essential information such as the method's source code, relevant method signatures, fields, dependencies, the hosting Java class, expected behavior, and details on related project classes will be provided. The objective is to generate a comprehensive test, complete with necessary imports, smooth compilation, and optimal coverage for both branches and lines.
